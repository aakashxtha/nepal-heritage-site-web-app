# Nepal Heritage Web App ‚Äî Roadmap and Status

This file captures what is done, what remains, known issues, and concrete next steps so we can resume quickly.

## Tech snapshot
- Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 (inline theme tokens)
- UI: minimal primitives (button, card) ‚Äî shadcn/ui optional later
- Icons: lucide-react
- Map: Leaflet via react-leaflet (client-only wrapper)
- Gallery: yet-another-react-lightbox (client-only)
- Animations: framer-motion (fully implemented with accessibility support)
- Images: Unsplash download endpoints + Wikimedia; Next/Image set to `images.unoptimized = true` for stability
- SEO: layout metadata, sitemap, robots, basic manifest

## Implemented
- App shell: header, footer, global styles, fonts (Inter + Cormorant Garamond)
- Pages: landing, interactive map, sites list, site detail, not-found, about, credits, privacy, cultural calendar
- UX: search + type filter, custom map markers ‚Üí site detail, hero + sections, timeline, gallery + lightbox, practical info cards
- Data: 4 UNESCO properties (Kathmandu Valley with 7 monument zones; Sagarmatha; Chitwan; Lumbini)
- Animations: Comprehensive framer-motion implementation (page transitions, hero animations, card hover effects, timeline reveals)
- Credits: Dynamic attribution system with photographer galleries and proper licensing info
- Cultural Calendar: Festival and seasonal event system with site filtering and seasonal highlights
- Custom Map: Themed markers with rich popups, hover interactions, and branded design
- Infra: Next config for remote images (Unsplash, Wikimedia, etc.) and stable image behavior

## Image status (current)
- Heroes: Kathmandu, Sagarmatha, Chitwan, Lumbini (Unsplash download endpoints)
- Kathmandu gallery: durbar, swayambhu, boudha

## Known issues / decisions
- Hydration warnings can be caused by extensions that inject attributes; we added `suppressHydrationWarning` to `<body>`. Prefer testing in incognito.
- Map and lightbox are client-only; dev HTML may show CSR bailout notes ‚Äî expected.
- Image optimization remains disabled (`unoptimized: true`) for stability with Unsplash redirects.
- All major features implemented and working reliably in current configuration.

## Backlog (what's left)
### Content & data
- Richer timelines; "Visitor Essentials" (permits, transit, fees matrix, etiquette, accessibility)
- Optional nested detail pages for each Kathmandu monument zone (stories, sub-map, more media)
- Expand cultural calendar with more festivals and events

### Visual polish & UX
- Breadcrumbs on detail pages
- Better focus/hover states and skeleton/loading/empty states
- Enhanced mobile responsiveness

### Accessibility
- Full keyboard navigation for gallery/lightbox
- ARIA audit for map controls and interactive elements
- Contrast checks against theme tokens

### Performance & reliability
- Consider image optimization approach (complex due to Unsplash redirects)
- Fine-grained code-splitting where helpful
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### SEO & metadata
- JSON-LD for `TouristAttraction` / `Place`
- Per-site OG images (generate with `@vercel/og` or satori)
- Canonicals; i18n-ready meta

### Offline / PWA
- App Router-friendly SW (e.g., next-pwa)
- Cache site JSON, critical images, and tiles (respect provider TOS)
- Offline page/experience

### Favorites & itinerary
- Local favorites; itinerary builder with share/export (PDF/ICS)

### Internationalization
- Add Nepali locale; split content by locale; localized dates/numbers

### Analytics & feedback
- Privacy-friendly analytics (Plausible)
- Feedback/correction form

### Testing & CI
- Vitest + RTL; Playwright (map ‚Üí site ‚Üí gallery ‚Üí back; search/filter)
- CI: lint, typecheck, tests on PRs

### Data / asset management
- Consider Contentlayer/Sanity or structured JSON for easier content updates
- Image CDN strategy + consistent aspect ratios
